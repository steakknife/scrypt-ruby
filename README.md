# [scrypt-ruby](https://github.com/steakknife/scrypt-ruby)


## Universal SCrypt adapter library


### Usage

```ruby
require 'scrypt-ruby' # instead of require 'scrypt'

The API is basically the same as [https://github.com/pbhogan/scrypt](), so it's a drop-in replacement for scrypt on JRuby or regular Rubies
